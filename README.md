Basic python Flask Web application where users can track the books they've owned and read  
___

I completed this project as part of a Digital Product Managment class. I learned about dynamic web applications, user expierence, and user interfaces:

1. Clone this repository to local computer.

2. Greate a new virtual envioremnt

3. Activate the new virtual enviorment

4. Install the dependencies 'pip instal -r requirment.txt'

5. Run the program using 'run flask'

Our application consists of a base.html, index.html, and a about page in the templates folder. In our index we ask questions about books then put the results in a list under. In our about page we have our names and a picture of ourselves.
